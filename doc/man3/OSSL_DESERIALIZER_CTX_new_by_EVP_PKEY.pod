=head1 DESCRIPTION

OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_new_by_EVP_PKEY() is a utility function that
creates a B<OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX>, finds all applicable deserializer
implementations and sets them up, so all the caller has to do next is
call functions like OSSL_DESERIALIZE_from_bio().

Internally OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_new_by_EVP_PKEY() searches for all
available L<EVP_KEYMGMT(3)> implementations, and then builds a list of all
potential deserializer implementations that may be able to process the
serialized input into data suitable for B<EVP_PKEY>s.  All these
implementations are implicitly fetched using I<libctx> and I<propquery>.

The search of deserializer implementations can be limited with
I<input_type>, which specifies a starting input type.  This is further
explained in L<OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_set_input_type(3)>.

If no suitable deserializer was found, OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_new_by_EVP_PKEY()
still creates a B<OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX>, but with no associated
deserializer (L<OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_num_deserializers(3)> returns
zero).  This helps the caller distinguish between an error when
creating the B<OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX>, and the lack the deserializer
support and act accordingly.

OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_set_passphrase() gives the implementation a
pass phrase to use when decrypting the serialized private key.
Alternatively, a pass phrase callback may be specified with the
following functions.

OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_set_pem_password_cb() and
OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_set_passphrase_ui() set up a callback method that
the implementation can use to prompt for a pass phrase, giving the caller
the choice of prefered pass phrase callback form.  These are called
indirectly, through an internal B<OSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK> function.

The internal B<OSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK> function caches the pass phrase, to
be re-used in all deserializations that are performed in the same
deserialization run
(for example, within one L<OSSL_DESERIALIZER_from_bio(3)> call).

=for comment the name OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_set_pem_password_cb() leaves
open the future possibility of having a function where the caller can set a
B<OSSL_PASSPHRASE_CALLBACK> method as another option.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_new_by_EVP_PKEY() returns a pointer to a
B<OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX>, or NULL if it couldn't be created.

OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_set_passphrase(),
OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_set_pem_password_cb() and
OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_set_passphrase_ui()
all return 1 on success, or 0 on failure.

=head1 NOTES

Parts of the function names are made to match already existing OpenSSL
names.

B<EVP_PKEY> in OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_new_by_EVP_PKEY() matches the type
name, thus making for the naming pattern
B<OSSL_DESERIALIZER_CTX_new_by_I<TYPE>>() when new types are handled.
